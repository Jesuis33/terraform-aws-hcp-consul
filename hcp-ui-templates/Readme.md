# HCP UI Templates

## Autogenerated: do not change manually

Everything in this directory is generated my running `make generate_templates` from the root directory. 

`make generate_templates` takes each example and converts it into two ui templates, for example `hcp-ec2-demo` is used to create `ec2` and `ec2-existing-vpc` templates.

## Manual testing

Since the templates contain placeholders, they cannot be run with terraform right away. `make dummy_data` will populate every placeholder in every template so that it is ready to be executed.
The vpc and the subnets, required by every `existing-vpc` template, are created by `examples/existing-vpc`.
